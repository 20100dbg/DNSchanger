DNSchanger is a really simple C# program that allows you to set DNS addresses.

DNSchanger comes with an handy set of common DNS services such as GoogleDNS, OpenDNS, Cloudflare, etc.


This program needs admin rights to change your settings. Also be warned that updating your settings by any means can trigger an alert on a firewall/antivirus program.
